  # ABOUT
  #   for an MVC framework, we can utilize mod_rewrite for URL`s
  #   and route them based on the URL value that mod_rewrite serves

  # ENABLE RE-WRITE ENGINE
  #   if not already enabled, enable rewriting of url
    RewriteEngine On

  # REWRITE RULE
  #   send all requests to index.php and preserve URI in the $1 variable
  #   NOTE: this will also redirect what would cause 404 responses for
  #   unresolved paths and files in the URL
    RewriteRule    ^(.*)$    index.php?$1    [QSA,L]

  # SYNTAX
  #   RewriteRule    [REGEX]        [FILE]          [FLAG]
  #   RewriteRule    ^(.*)$         index.php?$1    [QSA,L]
